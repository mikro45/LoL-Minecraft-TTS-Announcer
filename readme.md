### League of Legends Minecraft TTS Announcer

Uum, yeah, that's a thing.

It's a little bit quiet so make sure to adjust your sounds accordingly.

I am not a sound guy and couldn't be bothered by figuring out how to make it louder without distorting it.

## Installation

Just download the [announcer_mc_mikro45.fantome](announcer_mc_mikro45.fantome "announcer_mc_mikro45.fantome") and slap it in the [cslol-manager](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager/releases "cslol-manager").
